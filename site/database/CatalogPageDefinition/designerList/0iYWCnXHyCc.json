Yes, it is modular origami. It is also known as a Kusudama Ball. I had some difficulty making a small version of the ball because the units do not want to stay together. This is why I modified the modular unit to have pockets for the connection. The pockets allowed me to make a small version of Silvana's Star Ball without using any glue or paperclips. \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art \n \n<p>",
