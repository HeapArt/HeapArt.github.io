Yes, it is modular origami. It is also known as a Kusudama Ball. I had some difficulty making a small version of the ball because the units do not want to stay together. This is why I modified the modular unit to have pockets for the connection. The pockets allowed me to make a small version of Silvana's Star Ball without using any glue or paperclips. \n \nI hope you like it. Thanks for watching. \n \nHere at Heap Art, we are trying to help you practice origami on a regular bases. Every week I will select a minimum of 2 origami models and show you how to fold it.
