A few weeks ago I ask is there something my viewer wants to learn and a flicker or Frisbee was requested. \n \nThis origami model is a Frisbee, the Penta-Flinger designed by Ed Sullivan. It is made of 5 identical modules. The original origami instructions uses a 2x3 rectangular sheet for the modules. Here I'm folding a 2x3 rectangle from a square instead. The model is really fun to make and easy to throw. I know you are sure to like it. \n \nHere is the video timeline so you could jump through the video quickly: \n0:00 Introduction \n0:07 Flight Demonstration \n0:16 Creating a 2x3 rectangle from a square sheet \n1:40 Module Folding Instructions \n3:16 Penta-Flinger Assembly \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art \n \n<p>",
