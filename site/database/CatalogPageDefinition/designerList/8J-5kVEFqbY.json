Even though this paper craft resembles a dart, it is a actually a very steady glider and will glide gently when you fly it. This is an origami plane folded from a square sheet. Enjoy!!! \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 29 : Space Dart by Paul Jackson\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kD0rkZSGG78\">https://youtu.be/kD0rkZSGG78</a> \n \nThanks For Watching! \nWilson Lee  @Heap Art  \n \n<p>",
