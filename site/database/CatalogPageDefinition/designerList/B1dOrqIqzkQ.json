I will be the first to admit that this is a really difficult plane to fly. It requires a lot of tuning to fly nice and when it nose dive to the ground you will need to calibrate it again. Please enjoy this new Origami paper airplane. \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 041 : F-14 Tomcat by Michael G. LaFosse\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J3XlJgYhDZY\">https://youtu.be/J3XlJgYhDZY</a> \n \nThanks For Watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art  \n \n<p>",
