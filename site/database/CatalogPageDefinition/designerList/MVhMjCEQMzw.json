Today we will learn my new version of the Simple Rose. In this version I made some improvements to the simple rose and would like to share it with you. I stumbled across the simple rose and was instantly attracted to it. The simple rose is really beautiful. Once I learned how to fold it, I realized the rose was not symmetrical and I cam up with this solution. I hope you like it. \n \nThis rose is designed by me, Wilson Lee, and it is base on the Simple Rose (Omuta Rose A) by Fumiaki Shingu. \n \nThanks for watching. \n \nHere at Heap Art, we are trying to help you practice origami on a regular bases. Every week I will select a minimum of 2 origami models and show you how to fold it.
