It is quite pretty and is a stable glider. I hope you enjoy it. \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 036 : Stealth Wing by Paul Jackson\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PCrbaTbACXE\">https://youtu.be/PCrbaTbACXE</a> \n \nThanks For Watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art  \n \n<p>",
