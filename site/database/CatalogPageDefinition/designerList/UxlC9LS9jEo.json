This model is perfect for this occasion! I had the YouTube Play Button from Jo Nakashima at 200 Subscribers, and the Smiley Face Emoji from Jo Nakashima at 500 Subscribers. This model from Jeremy Shafer marinates the two together! As usual Thank-You for supporting my Channel and Enjoy!!! \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee  @Heap Art \n \n \n<p>",
