This origami airplane is relatively simple to fold and it could fly really far when the wings are properly calibrated. This is an origami plane folded from a square sheet. Enjoy!!! \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 31 : Shuttle Dart by Michael G. LaFosse\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yIhrTK9_uRQ\">https://youtu.be/yIhrTK9_uRQ</a> \n \nThanks For Watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art   \n \n<p>",
