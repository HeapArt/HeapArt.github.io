It's a modular origami model that looks like a combination of the Penultimate dodecahedron by Robert Neal and the 30 Unit Sonobe Icosahedron. Learn how to fold the module and assemble it in this video. Less than a minute origami. As usual, Enjoy!!! \n \nA side note for future reference. PHiZZ is an accronyme for Pentagon-Hexagon Zig-Zag. The unit is called the Pentagon-Hexagon Zig-Zag unit or PHiZZ Unit for short. \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee@Heap Art  \n \n \n<p>",
