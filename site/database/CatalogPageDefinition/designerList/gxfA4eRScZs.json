As I am an Engineer, therefore part of me is a mathematician, the mathematician is screaming with joy. This model is a physical model of 4 intersecting planes in 3 dimensional space. I hope you enjoy it as mush as I do. \n \nTo make this model you will need 12 pieces of paper to make 12 modules. Ideally 4 colors for the 4 different planes. Therefore 3 modules for each color.  \n \nHere at Heap Art, we are trying to inspire people to connect with each other through origami and paper folding.
