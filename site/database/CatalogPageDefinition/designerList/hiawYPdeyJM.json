This model is special because it has forward sweeping wings and it's flight path is a sequence of up and down. \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 005 : Astro Tube by Stephen Weiss\", please find it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A45Bd6ruHVE\">https://youtu.be/A45Bd6ruHVE</a> \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art \n \n<p>",
