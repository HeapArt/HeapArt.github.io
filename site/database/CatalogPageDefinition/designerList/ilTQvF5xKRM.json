This plane needs to be release really high. It will dive and glide just like a bat. It is 2020 October 27, just in time for Halloween. This is an origami plane folded from a square sheet. Enjoy!!! \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 024 : Shuttlecock by Michael G. LaFosse\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qaaBMV0rFG0\">https://youtu.be/qaaBMV0rFG0</a> \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee@Heap Art \n \n \n<p>",
