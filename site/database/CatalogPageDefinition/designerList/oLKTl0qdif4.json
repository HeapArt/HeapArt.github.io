This origami paper airplane is well balances and could maintain flight. If you try to fold it it looks kind of similar to the Hunter designed by Kunihiko Kasahara. Let me know, which one do you prefer. You could review the Hunter here :  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KBk0ohOqNko\">https://youtu.be/KBk0ohOqNko</a> \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 043 : The Cutter by Paul Jackson\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A06-C7pYaD0\">https://youtu.be/A06-C7pYaD0</a> \n \nThanks For Watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art  \n \n<p>",
