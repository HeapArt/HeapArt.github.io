When it flies, it gives the illusion that it is the traditional airplane flying backwards. \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 011 : Concorde By Kunihiko Kasahara\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6ZeeZc4nCsA\">https://youtu.be/6ZeeZc4nCsA</a> \n \nThanks for watching! \nWilson Lee @Heap Art  \n \n<p>",
