I will be publishing a new video with a new paper plane every week. Here at Heap Art we are a Origami Channel. By subscribing, you will be receiving origami tutorials as well. Every Tuesday and Sunday I will show you how to fold something new and never seen on this channel. \n \nThis is Paper plane 12 of our 100 Exotic Paper Airplane Challenge. It's the Backwards Plane by Carlos Gonzalez Garcia. When it flies, it gives the illusion that it is the traditional airplane flying backwards. \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 011 : Concorde By Kunihiko Kasahara\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6ZeeZc4nCsA\">https://youtu.be/6ZeeZc4nCsA</a> \n \nHere at Heap Art, we are trying to inspire people to connect using origami. If you like origami and if you like paper airplanes, please remember to subscribe. I will be delivering something new to you every week.
