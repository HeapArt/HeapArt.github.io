      "body": "<p>This origami NASA Space Shuttle, also known as the orbiter, is simply amazing. It could glide really far for it's size. It is an origami Space shuttle that flies. Originally I thought it will flop. However it is able to glide and lands really gracefully. It is very satisfying to watch. This is the origami Space shuttle designed by Gery Hsu and is the 45th member of our 100 exotic paper airplane challenge. Folded from a single square sheet. I hope like it. Enjoy! \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 44 : Classique by Alain Georgeot & Eric Joisel\", you could watch it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oLKTl0qdif4\">https://youtu.be/oLKTl0qdif4</a> \n \nThanks For Watching! \nWilson Lee  @Heap Art  \n \n<p>",
