Today we are making Paper Plane 008, the Dollar Bill Glider 2 by Stephen Weiss. This is the second out of the three Dollar Bill Gliders from Steven Weiss book. Once again this model was intended to be folded with an American dollar bill. for our purpose, any paper divided along the long side will do. I find that this glider is a really gentle glider and I had a really good time throwing it across the room while my 13 month old daughter chase after it. I hope you will all enjoy it too. \n \nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 007 : Dollar Bill Glider 1 by Stephen Weiss\", please find it at  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_67Ye9vuq40\">https://youtu.be/_67Ye9vuq40</a> \n \nThanks for watching. \n \n<p>",
