I saw another dodecahedron 2-3 weeks ago and really want to make one. However, the instructions I received were based on an A4 piece of paper. Living in Canada, A4 paper is not readily available. This made the model in-accessible to anyone living in Canada or the USA. As such I spent the pass 2 weeks developing this model, the module is made using a square shape paper instead of A4, making the model more universal. You'll need 12 piece of square paper for this model.\n\nI hope you enjoy my Dodecahedron! This model is designed by me, Wilson Lee.\n\nPlease find the time stamp of the tutorial below.

Today we are making Paper Plane 008, the Dollar Bill Glider 2 by Stephen Weiss. This is the second out of the three Dollar Bill Gliders from Steven Weiss book. Once again this model was intended to be folded with an American dollar bill. for our purpose, any paper divided along the long side will do. I find that this glider is a really gentle glider and I had a really good time throwing it across the room while my 13 month old daughter chase after it. I hope you will all enjoy it too.\n\nIf you missed my last Exotic Paper Airplane \"Paper Plane 007 : Dollar Bill Glider 1 by Stephen Weiss\", please find it at https://youtu.be/_67Ye9vuq40\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n",

However, I'm teaching this method in the video because it is the easiest way to fold this origami Lily. This origami lily is the best gift to impress anyone. This is because regardless of the accuracy of the folds, the origami lily will look great. The video is relatively long, I hope you watch it until the end.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n",

Yes, it is modular origami. It is also known as a Kusudama Ball. I had some difficulty making a small version of the ball because the units do not want to stay together. This is why I modified the modular unit to have pockets for the connection. The pockets allowed me to make a small version of Silvana's Star Ball without using any glue or paperclips.\n\nI hope you like it.

In the video, the orange paper is for right hand throwing and the yellow paper is for left hand throwing.\n\nI learned how to fold this ninja star when I was 8 or 9 years old. My parents owned a store in a shopping mall and the store in front of ours had a son whom was around 5 years older than me. One day he asked me if I knew how to fold a ninja star and I said yes. Then I folded a ninja star with 4 spikes, the one we all know and love. Afterward he said he would show me how to fold a different one and taught me how to fold this one, a square shape ninja star.\n\nThis is a special ninja star that throws really well and really simple to fold.

It was mainly to do some activities that are outdoors to enjoy the sun at the time. Our main mode of transport is the metro system in our city. if you are not familiar with the term metro system, It's just another way of saying the \"subway\" in other parts of the world. At that time our metro system had these machines that would dispense tickets we to use as transfers to us the bus systems. All of us in the summer camp would take several of these tickets to make this ninja stars on the way to our destination, including the volunteers. The tickets were made of the same type of paper as news paper so the ninja stars were not rigid enough to throw, but we did you them as book marks.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n",
